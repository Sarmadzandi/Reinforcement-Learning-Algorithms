## Introduction

This repository includes implementations of the following algorithms:

- **Deep Q-Learning**: Utilizing experience replay and target networks.
- **Multi-Armed Bandits**: Including strategies like epsilon-greedy and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB).
- **N-step Tree Backup**: Implementation for n-step bootstrapping.
- **Off-Policy Learning**: Algorithms such as Q-learning.
- **On-Policy Learning**: Methods like SARSA.
- **Thompson Sampling**: Bayesian approach for balancing exploration and exploitation.
- **Expected SARSA**: An enhancement over SARSA with expected rewards.
- **Gradient Preference-Based Methods**: Various policy gradient algorithms.
- **Policy Iteration**: Classical dynamic programming algorithm for solving MDPs.
